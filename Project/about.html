		Zach Armentrout was born to Karen and Jeff Armentrout in Ohio in 1992.  Both of his parents were teachers, and he spent his childhood going to school at the schools they worked at.  He went through school with a furvor for learning, and always wanted to look at the latest and greatest gadgets.

		When Zach was around 8, his parents wanted to have more children.  They learned that they weren't able to though, so they explored other options.  They spent a few years working up a case study for themselves with the Ohio Children Services group, and ended up fostering multiple children.  After a few foster care situations, they decided they were ready to adopt.

        After a few years, they were able to adopt many children.  The end total was 9 children, including Zach.  He learned at a very early age to help around the house and to help with his siblings, which lead him to grow up a little faster than anyone probably intended, but that ultimately helped him in the end. 
        </p>

        Now, Zach is successfully working at the Reynolds &amp; Reynolds Company in the Desktop Support (IT) team as a Desktop Support Engineer.  While he works, he is also attending school at Western Govenors University, studying software and web development.  He eventually hopes to start his own business or to work in the development field.
